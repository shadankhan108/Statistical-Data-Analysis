## Task 1: Define and Print a String

unit_name <- "SIT741"

# Create and print the string

###Question 2 Use rbinom() to generate 30 random data observations. Set the number of trials
###to 10 and choose your own value of p (the probability of success).
```{r}
# First we Generate 30 random data observations using rbinom
set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
n <- 30
trials <- 10
p <- 0.6

# Generate random binomial data
random_data <- rbinom(n, size = trials, prob = p)
# Print the generated data
print(random_data)
```

###Question 3 Plot its histogram along with the theoretical distribution.
###- To use stat_function(), you can define a new function of a single variable using your trials
###and probability parameters, e.g.:
###dbinom_10_5 <- function(x) {dbinom(x,size = 10,prob = 0.5)}
###- You may also need to include the value of n as one of your stat_function() arguments,
###which gives the number of points to evaluate on. The default is 101, but you need your
###function to only be evaluated on whole numbers

```{r}
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Sample data: replace this with your actual data
data <- rbinom(100, size = 10, prob = 0.6)

# Plot histogram
ggplot(data.frame(x = data), aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 1, fill = "green", color = "black") +
  
  # Add the theoretical binomial distribution
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dbinom(x, size = 10, prob = 0.6),
                color = "orange", size = 1) +
  
  labs(title = "Histogram with Theoretical Binomial Distribution",
       x = "Number of Successes",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()

```
###4. Use mle2() to estimate the parameters of a normal distribution that matches your data.
###- Define the negative log-likelihood function
###- Choose appropriate initial parameters and then use mle2() to find your estimates.
###- Comment on how these compare to the theoretical values of the mean and standard
###deviation obtained using np and sqrt(npr).
###- Repeat the process with trials set to 100. How do the estimates for mean and sd
###compare now?

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(bbmle)

# Function to calculate the negative log-likelihood for normal distribution
neg_log_likelihood <- function(mu, sigma, data) {
  -sum(dnorm(data, mean = mu, sd = sigma, log = TRUE))
}

# Generate data with prob = 0.6, size = 10, and trials = 100
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
data_100 <- rbinom(100, size = 10, prob = 0.6)

# Perform Maximum Likelihood Estimation
fit <- mle2(minuslogl = function(mu, sigma) neg_log_likelihood(mu, sigma, data_100),
            start = list(mu = mean(data_100), sigma = sd(data_100)),
            data = list(data = data_100))

# Display the results
summary(fit)

# Compare with theoretical values
mean_theoretical <- mean(data_100)
sd_theoretical <- sd(data_100)
cat("Estimated Mean:", coef(fit)["mu"], "\n")
cat("Estimated SD:", coef(fit)["sigma"], "\n")
cat("Theoretical Mean:", mean_theoretical, "\n")
cat("Theoretical SD:", sd_theoretical, "\n")

# Repeat with different sample size
data_10 <- rbinom(10, size = 10, prob = 0.6)

fit_10 <- mle2(minuslogl = function(mu, sigma) neg_log_likelihood(mu, sigma, data_10),
               start = list(mu = mean(data_10), sigma = sd(data_10)),
               data = list(data = data_10))

# Display the results for smaller sample size
summary(fit_10)

# Compare with theoretical values
mean_theoretical_10 <- mean(data_10)
sd_theoretical_10 <- sd(data_10)
cat("Estimated Mean (10 trials):", coef(fit_10)["mu"], "\n")
cat("Estimated SD (10 trials):", coef(fit_10)["sigma"], "\n")
cat("Theoretical Mean (10 trials):", mean_theoretical_10, "\n")
cat("Theoretical SD (10 trials):", sd_theoretical_10, "\n")

###Question 5 Read the “abalone” data set using:
abalone <- read.table(“http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/
abalone.data”, sep = “,”)
- Information about the attributes can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machinelearning-databases/abalone/abalone.names
- replace the variables names V1, V2, etc., with appropriate labels.


```{r}
# Load the dataset
abalone <- read.table("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data", sep = ",")

# Replace default column names (V1, V2, ...) with appropriate labels
colnames(abalone) <- c("Sex", "Length", "Diameter", "Height", 
                       "WholeWeight", "ShuckedWeight", "VisceraWeight", 
                       "ShellWeight", "Rings")

# Preview the dataset to verify the column names
head(abalone)

```
###Question 6 Use ggplot to produce:
###- a multi-grid barplot showing the distribution of age (V9) for each of males, females and
###infants
###- comparative violin plot to compare distribution of males, females and infants (V1) with
###respect to one of variables V2-V8.
###- comparative boxplot to compare distribution for each age (V9) with respect to one of the
###variables V2-V8. You will need to ensure that age is a factor variable to use geom_boxplot().
###- a scatterplot showing the relationship between one of the variables V2-V8 with age (V9),
###filtering the sex (V1) to one of either males, females or infants. Add a geom_smooth()
###trendline using method = “lm”

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# Convert Rings to Age (Rings + 1.5 years is the age)
abalone$Age <- abalone$Rings + 1.5

# Create a barplot showing the distribution of age by Sex
ggplot(abalone, aes(x = Age)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_grid(~ Sex) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution by Sex (Male, Female, Infant)", x = "Age (Years)", y = "Count")

# Violin plot to compare WholeWeight distribution by Sex
ggplot(abalone, aes(x = Sex, y = WholeWeight, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Comparative Violin Plot: WholeWeight by Sex", x = "Sex", y = "Whole Weight (grams)")
# Ensure Age is a factor variable
abalone$Age <- as.factor(abalone$Age)

# Create a boxplot comparing Length (V2) distribution by Age
ggplot(abalone, aes(x = Age, y = Length, fill = Age)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot: Length Distribution by Age", x = "Age (Years)", y = "Length (mm)")
# Filter for males and create a scatterplot
ggplot(subset(abalone, Sex == "M"), aes(x = Age, y = Diameter)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot: Diameter vs Age (Males)", x = "Age (Years)", y = "Diameter (mm)")

```
###Question 7 Build a linear model using lm() for the data in the scatterplot created in step 6.
###Print the coefficients.

```{r}
# Build a linear model using lm() for males, predicting Diameter based on Age
model <- lm(Diameter ~ Age, data = subset(abalone, Sex == "M"))

# Print the coefficients of the linear model
summary(model)$coefficients
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
