###1. Define a string including your name, unit name, task name; and print

```{r }
my_information <- "Name: SHADAN KHAN, Unit: SIT741 , Task: Data Analysis in R in GLM"
print(my_information)
```
###2. Load the same abalone data set as for the previous pass task.
```{r}
#Loading the Abalone Data Set

abalone_data <- read.csv("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data" , header=FALSE)
colnames(abalone_data) <- c("Sex", "Length" , "Diameter" , "Height" ,"Whole_Weight", "Shucked_Weight","Viscera_Weight","Shell_Weight","Rings" )
###Converting Rings To Age
abalone_data$Age <- abalone_data$Rings + 1.5
```

###3. Build a linear model using lm() that predicts the age (V9) from two of the numeric variables (V2-V8).

```{r}
#Showcasing Linear model predicting Age from Two numerical variables i.e. (Length & Whole_Weight)
linear_model <- lm(Age ~ Length + Whole_Weight,data = abalone_data)
summary(linear_model)
```
###4. Use the broom and ggplot packages to check the QQ-plot, residuals (for the whole
###model, as well as for each predictor variable), and high leverage points (and whether
###or not any outliers should be excluded from the model).

```{r}
#We load required packages
library(broom)
library(ggplot2)

#We will check residuals & QQ-Plot 
model_diagram <- augment(linear_model)

#We will make QQ-Plot
ggplot(model_diagram,aes(sample = .resid)) + 
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line() +
  ggtitle("QQ Plot for the Residuals")

#We will showcase residual plot for whole model

ggplot(model_diagram,aes(x = .fitted, y=.resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  ggtitle("Residuals vs Fitted")

#We will check for high leverage points
ggplot(model_diagram, aes(x= .hat, y=.std.resid)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = .cooksd > 4/(nrow(abalone_data)- length(coef(linear_model))))) +
  ggtitle("Leverage Points")

```
###5. Fit a generalised linear model using glm() with an additional predictor variable
###compared to what you have in step 3. Comment briefly on differences of fit between
###the models.

```{r}
#First determining GLM with one additional predictor variable (Diameter)

glm_model <- glm(Age ~ Length + Whole_Weight + Diameter , family = gaussian(), data = abalone_data)
summary(glm_model)

#Note: Here we can compare the summary outputs of 'lm_model' and 'glm_model' to discuss the fit , residual deviance, AIC & model cofficients.

#Now comparing AIC of both models
AIC (linear_model , glm_model)
```
###6. Download the hospital emergency department admissions dataset.

```{r}
heda <- read.csv("https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/6bfec5ea-207e-4d67-8965-c7e72290844b/resource/33d84954-b13a-4f4e-afb9-6468e287fa3c/download/govhack3.csv")

summary(heda)

head(heda)

```
###7. Plot the attendance and admissions data over time (as a single graph) for one of the
###hospitals using ggplot. You will need to make some adjustments to the dataset in
###order to do this. You can use, e.g., dmy(“10-JUL-2024”) in the lubridate package to
###convert it to a ‘date’ datatype.

```{r}
#loading lubridate
library(lubridate)

#Converting data column to data type 
heda$Date <- dmy(heda$X)

#Now we will filter data for specific hospital
colnames(heda)

#now by plotting admissions and attendance over time 

ggplot(heda, aes(x = Date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y= Fremantle.Hospital),color = "green") +
  geom_line(aes(y= X.7), color= "orange")


```
### 8. Use the wkday functions to show the data for a single day of the week and plot the
###data over time, then compare this to the results for another day.

```{r}
#First we Filter data for the single day of the week (e.g Tuesday)

library(lubridate)

tuesday_data <- heda[weekdays(heda$Date) == "Tuesday" , ]

#Now Plotting Tuesday data over time
ggplot(tuesday_data, aes(x= Date , y = Fremantle.Hospital)) + geom_line()

#Filtering and plotting data for another day 

thursday_data <- heda[weekdays(heda$Date) == "Thursday" , ]

ggplot(thursday_data , aes(x= Date , y = Fremantle.Hospital)) + geom_line()

```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
